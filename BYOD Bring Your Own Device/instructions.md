# Welcome to BYOD Hack Challenge!

The concept of **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** originates from the IT and enterprise world, where employees were encouraged to connect their personal laptops and smartphones to corporate networks. Over time, BYOD has evolved into a broader paradigm, highlighting the value of **personalized, user-driven technology ecosystems**.  

In the context of **Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs)**, BYOD takes on a new dimension. Instead of limiting drivers and passengers to pre-installed, manufacturer-defined features, vehicles can become **open platforms** where users bring their own devices, e.g., portable coffee machine, gaming gear, VR headsets, karaoke microphones, etc., into the mobility experience.  

This shift has the potential to **unlock personalization, flexibility, and entirely new in-car experiences**. To demonstrate this vision in practice, the **BYOD Hack Challenge** rallies developers, designers, and hardware tinkerers to prove the power of [digital.auto](https://digital.auto) by wiring their own devices into three showcase apps:

- **Personalized Passenger Welcome** <br> 
The vehicle recognizes the passenger and adapts the environment automatically ‚Äî> adjusting seats, lights, turning on Coffee Machine and Air Despenser. This transforms a simple ride into a tailored, welcoming experience for everyone who enters.

- **Bring-your-Own Karaoke**  

- **In-Vehicle Gaming** <br> 
Passengers can connect gaming devices such as a piano board, where every note played is reflected in the car's Infotainment System, turning the car into a musical playground. Another game leverages live ADAS data to create an interactive driving simulation game, blending real vehicle signals with fun, gamified experiences


## Challenge Overview

During the hackathon, teams connect their devices to the SDV runtime via the digital.auto Playground and control a variety of in-car features through VSS APIs:

- **Ambient Lights** ‚Äì change colors, brightness, or make some cool light patterns.
- **Coffee Machine** ‚Äì trigger brewing cycles or create fun ‚Äúcar caf√©‚Äù experiences.
- **Air Despenser** ‚Äì  scents, synchronize with mood or events.
- **Smart windows** ‚Äì adjust tint, transparency, or create dynamic visual effects. 

In addition, participants will have access to dummy ADAS data (e.g., speed, lane position, nearby objects), enabling them to build their own advanced applications ‚Äî from gamified driving simulations to innovative safety and personalization features.
  
all inside a **Vintage car rReborn as an SDV Test Vehicle**.

### digital.auto Playground

The hackathon runs on the [digital.auto Playground](https://playground.digital.auto/) ‚Äì the central program environment for participants.  

The digital.auto Playground is the heart of the BYOD Hack Challenge. 
It acts as both a simulator and a live bridge to the physical vehicle, letting participants experiment freely with ideas before deploying them in the real world. 
By using standardized VSS APIs, developers can quickly wire up consumer gadgets, create new mobility features, and validate their concepts instantly. 
This combination of safe virtual prototyping and real-world mirroring makes the Playground the ultimate testbed for innovation.

- Playground shares the **same SDV Runtime** as the vintage test vehicle.  
- Any **VSS (Vehicle Signal Specification)**‚Äìbased animation or value change in Playground is immediately reflected in the car.  
- This allows developers to **prototype and validate ideas in real time**, ensuring that what they build in Playground directly maps onto the physical vehicle.  

üëâ Think of Playground as your **safe lab + remote control**, while the vintage car acts as the **real-world mirror** of your experiments.

### EDCAR (NSU Prinz)

Our vintage NSU Prinz, reborn as EDCAR, is the centerpiece of the hackathon. It is powered by the dreamKIT platform from digital.auto (https://www.digital.auto/dreamkit)
, which seamlessly connects the physical car to the digital.auto Playground so that every prototype built virtually can be mirrored in the real vehicle.

Inside EDCAR, multiple processors work together to bring modern SDV capabilities into the classic car:

- High-performance SoCs (e.g., Qualcomm 8378) running Android OS to power infotainment and app experiences.
- Microcontrollers and edge boards (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino-class MCUs) to handle real-time controls such as lights, actuators, and connected devices.
- dreamKIT middleware providing standardized APIs for VSS-based communication between apps, devices, and vehicle systems.


This hybrid setup allows participants to experiment safely with both cloud-native SDV software and hardware-level integrations, demonstrating how consumer devices can become part of a modern mobility ecosystem.

## Resources

Participants have access to the following tools and references to prototype quickly:

- digital.auto official site
- digital.auto Playground
- Playground Documentation
- EDCAR runtime
- Vehicle Signal Specification APIs(VSS)
- dreamKIT GitHub Repository


Example VSS APIs

Below are some example VSS signals that you can use to control devices or read data during the hackathon.

**Ambient Light**

- Vehicle.Body.AmbientLight.IsOn ‚Äì turn ambient lights on/off
- Vehicle.Cabin.Light.AmbientLight.Row1.DriverSide.Color ‚Äì set RGB color of lights
- Vehicle.Body.AmbientLight.Intensity ‚Äì adjust brightness


**Coffee Machine**

- Vehicle.BYOD.CoffeeMachine.Brew ‚Äì start/stop brewing

**Air Dispenser**

- Vehicle.BYOD.Airfreshner.IsOn ‚Äì switch air dispenser on/off

**ADAS Data (Dummy Feed)**

- Vehicle.Speed ‚Äì current vehicle speed


to quickly prototype and integrate their ideas.

## Live Demo

Teams will demo their solutions **live** to a jury of OEM and tech-platform experts.  

The goal:  
Show that standardized **BYOD interfaces** can turn almost any consumer gadget into a **safe, revenue-ready automotive feature**‚Äîand spark the next wave of in-car delight.
